Melissa is a contributing author for Verse By Verse Ministry International. To begin Melissa’s faith story at the beginning would be entirely impossible, but to say that salvation came through adversity would be a good way to sum it up.

When Melissa’s only child, Wil (with one l) was diagnosed with cancer at age three, she “bargained" with God that she would do anything He asked of her if He would save her son. God took her up on that offer, and brought about a series of amazing circumstances which culminated in her salvation a year later.  Her years in service to her Lord have been a wild, tumultuous, wonderful ride, including her most recent work with VBVMI.

Because her walk with God began late in life, Melissa understands the frustrations of learning to use the Bible in a practical way. Her own desire to dig for life-transforming truth led her to Precept Ministries, where she was trained as a Precept Upon Precept group leader. Melissa draws heavily on that training in preparing written material to support VBVMI. Her hope is always to demonstrate that God’s word is relevant and usable, and that life-changing truth is available to anyone who seeks it.

Melissa has a B.A. in University Studies with an English/Journalism emphasis from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, where she met her husband Chris.  She volunteers in the library at her son’s school, operates the mobile library for her church out of her guest-room closet, writes book reviews for the church newsletter…there might be a pattern forming here. She is also an active small group leader and an occasional speaker/teacher. Currently, Melissa and her family call Northwest Arkansas home.
