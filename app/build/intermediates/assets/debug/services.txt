Recorded Bible Teaching

We offer hundreds of hours of verse-by-verse Bible teaching recorded live and
available online for free in MP3 format or through our podcast catalog. Over
2.5M free Bible lessons are download from the Verse By Verse Ministry
International (VBVMI) website annually in over 200 countries around the world.
In a few short years, VBVM has become a leading source of free, in-depth Bible
teaching on the internet. Read some of the testimonials submitted by our students.

Study Notes

Our ministry offers written teaching notes in convenient PDF format for use by
students and teachers alike. These notes are excellent materials for pastors, small
group and Sunday school leaders, missionaries, or any Bible-minded instructor
looking for assistance in personal study or pulpit ministry.

All our resource materials are the original work of VBVMI and have been
developed from the Bible teaching of Pastor Stephen Armstrong. As with the rest
of our resource library, our written resources are offered for download free of
charge with a generous copryright policy. Teaching notes can be found within each
Bible study (learn how to access our teaching).

Answers to Personal Bible Questions

The VBVMI staff always places a priority on providing personalized answers
to Bible questions submitted by our students. These answers are often preserved in
the Bible Questions & Answers section of website. Feel free to send us your
hardest Bible question, and we'll do our best to research the answer and respond
with a complete analysis from scripture.
