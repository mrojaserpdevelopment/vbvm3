About the Founder

STEPHEN ARMSTRONG
Director/President

Stephen Armstrong is President and the principal teacher for Verse By Verse
Ministry International. He came to know the Lord in his early 30s, while serving as
an Air Force officer. After becoming a believer, Stephen experienced God's call to
learn and teach the Bible, so in 1997 Stephen left the military, found a job in
Colorado, and began studying the Bible.

As he devoted himself to study, Stephen developed a love for in-depth, verse-byverse
teaching of God's word, recognizing it to be the means God has appointed to
persuade the unbeliever of the truth of the Gospel and equip the saints for the work
of ministry (Rom 10:17; Eph 4:14-15).

In 2001, Stephen received God's call to move to San Antonio, Texas, where he
began to teach the Bible verse-by-verse in churches throughout the area. In 2003
he participated in a small church plant and was called to pastor Living Word
Fellowship. That year he also founded Verse By Verse Ministry of San Antonio in
the desire to offer his unique style of in-depth Bible teaching to a worldwide
audience via the internet.

Stephen's responsibilities on the VBVMI Board include overseeing all teaching
and doctrine, setting ministry vision and strategy, directing ministry operations,
and conducting ministry public appearances. Stephen lives in San Antonio, Texas
with his wife and two children. Stephen also serves as senior pastor of Oak Hill
Bible Church in Austin, Texas, which is not affiliated with Verse By Verse Ministry
International.
