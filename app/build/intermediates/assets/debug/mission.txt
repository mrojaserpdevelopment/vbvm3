Our Mission

Verse by Verse Ministry International is a non-profit, non-denominational,
Christian ministry dedicated to promoting the preaching and teaching of God's
word clearly and boldly, in its proper historical and theological context, and for the
purposes God has ordained: to persuade the unbeliever of the truth of the Gospel
and to equip the saints for the work of ministry. This ministry was founded in 2003
on a commitment to provide compelling, verse-by-verse teaching of God's word at
no charge (2Cor 2:17), thus ensuring the whole counsel of God is proclaimed (Acts
20:27).

We believe every Christian is commanded by New Testament scripture to become
a life-long student of God's word, and this ministry is working to support that goal
in our students' lives. While many online teaching ministries exist today, we
believe our ministry is unique in what we teach and in how we teach.

Verse By Verse Ministry International teaches entire books of the Bible, and our
studies explain carefully and clearly the text of scripture without being distracted
by discussions of popular culture, politics, or denominational disputes. Our
teaching schedule doesn't vary with the seasons or the holidays. Week after week,
we endeavor to teach what God's word says, eventually intending to teach all 66
books of the Bible.

Secondly, we teach the word of God using an in-depth, verse-by-verse style. In a
time when most Christian teachers either ignore the Bible altogether or merely
skim over the surface of the text, jumping from passage to passage regurgitating
traditional interpretations, our ministry digs deeper to uncover the depth and
breadth of scripture's meaning. We rarely resort to teaching in a topical style,
preferring to let God's word guide our understanding, and we never avoid the
difficult passages. We believe the meat of God's word is where real spiritual
nutrition is found, and we are determined to feast on everything God has provided
in His word.

Our ministry operations focus on authoring, organizing and conducting group
verse-by-verse Bible studies; preaching expository sermons from pulpits
throughout the U.S.; maintaining and expanding the Verse By Verse Ministry
International website; conducting Bible conferences and seminars; and responding
to Bible questions submitted by students through the ministry website. In addition
to serving students, the ministry also supports the needs of teachers and churches
in offering small group Bible education in a methodical, in-depth manner.

The Verse by Verse Ministry International website is the centerpiece of the
ministry's work. The site began as a simple way to distribute teachings to Bible
class students, but the Lord has grown it into a Bible study resource for millions of
students around the world. The Verse by Verse Ministry International website
distributes over 2,000,000 teachings each year to listeners from over 200 countries
free of charge. Glory be to God!

Verse by Verse Ministry International also maintains a growing mailing list of
ministry supporters. Our list is used to announce new teachings and classes,
distribute a ministry newsletter and publicize other news of the ministry.
Information provided for our mailing list is never sold or shared with others.

Verse by Verse Ministry International operates on the provision that God makes
available through the prayers and financial contributions of our supporters. The
ministry offers all its services and materials free of charge. For information on how
