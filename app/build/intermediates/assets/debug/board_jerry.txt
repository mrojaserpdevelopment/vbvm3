Jerry's faith in God began at a very early age as he was raised in a Christian family led by a father who was in full time ministry. He remembers Bible stories, prayer meetings, family devotions, Christian music and church attendance as always being a part of his life. At a very early age, Jerry repented of his sins and trusted in Jesus for salvation as his parents led him in a prayer of repentance and faith in his home.

Jerry believes being committed to Jesus means serving Him with his whole life, in every area of his life, giving Him all of the honor and glory.  Jerry takes inspiration from Philippians 2:12-13, which says, “Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.”  Out of gratitude for what Jesus has done by dying on the cross in our place, Jerry endeavors to “work out" his salvation with fear and trembling, spending time studying the Bible, praying, having regular fellowship with other Christians, and spreading the good news of the Gospel whenever given the opportunity.

Jerry is the newest member of the Verse By Verse Ministry International Board and brings many years of evangelistic mission and corporate experience to our teaching ministry. Jerry lives and works in San Antonio with his wife. He has a grown son who is engaged in pastoral ministry.
