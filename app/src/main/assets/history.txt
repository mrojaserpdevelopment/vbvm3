Our History

Verse By Verse Ministry International (VBVMI) was founded in 2003 and began
as a simple way of distributing recorded teachings taken from the Bible studies of
Stephen Armstrong, a Sunday school teacher and itinerant preacher. As Stephen
taught the Bible in churches, homes and neighborhood club houses around San
Antonio, attendance and interest grew, both in his teaching and the ministry
website. Soon, other men and women with a similar love for God's word joined in
the work of the ministry, and Verse By Verse Ministry began to take shape.
By 2005, the ministry began to receive requests from churches around the country
to hear Stephen teach, and the online audience began requesting more content than
the existing website could accommodate. With the help of a website developer,
Stephen began work on a new version of the website, and by Fall 2005 the first
major update to the VBVMI website launched. Almost immediately, the site
experienced a surge in traffic and a regular pattern of donations.
The need to accommodate this rise in financial giving to the ministry led to the
establishment of a formal non-profit organization called Verse By Verse Ministry of
San Antonio and the appointment of a Board of Directors to provide oversight and
accountability.

Over the next several years the ministry grew steadily by God's grace. In 2008, the
ministry began producing written studies, and by 2009 the ministry website was
receiving over 1 million hits and distributing nearly 50,000 Bible lessons each
month.

To accommodate the traffic and interest, the ministry designed and launched a new
website in July 2009 - a major undertaking that contributed to an accelerated
expansion of VBVMI's growth and reach for Bible students around the world.
After 18 months in service, the site delivered nearly 600,000 hours of Bible
teaching worldwide and logged over 1 million visitors annually.

In January 2011, the ministry launched our third generation website to better serve
our growing audience. The new site incorporated better navigation and a topical
index. Also, it was deployed on a new, robust database infrastructure to handle
substantial increases in traffic and to offer more kinds of content.

In the three years that followed, the ministry began a period of sustained and
dramatic growth, doubling in audience every 6-8 months. By the end of January
2013, the website was taking over 2.5 million hits and distributing over 150,000
audio lessons per month. Also, the ministry launched its first smartphone app and a
ministry Facebook page, which further increased growth. This dramatic growth
soon put new strains on our website, leading to another redesign and a new
database architecture.

In 2014, VBVMI launched our current website hoping to stay ahead of the growing
demand while providing a much-improved experience. In addition to improved
navigation and visual appeal, the site added more powerful search capabilities, a
video section and a much improved webpage audio player.

Finally, VBVM continues reaching out into more parts of the world with live
events for students and counseling to pastors, teachers and others who desire to
minister according to and through God's word. The ministry is actively teaching in
North America, Europe, Africa, Central America, and Asia, prompting the Board to
change the ministry name in 2012 to Verse By Verse Ministry International to
reflect our worldwide reach.

We also continue to add volunteer and select paid staff and Bible teachers to assist
in the development and presentation of new curriculum and written study
materials. Though the ministry is growing and adapting to meet many needs, the
primary goal of the ministry remains unchanged: to teach God's word clearly and
boldly until all sixty-six books of the Bible verse-by-verse have been proclaimed
verse-by-verse and made available online for free.
