Where Your Money Goes

We value the hard-earned money people donate to Verse By Verse Ministry
International (VBVMI) and take great responsibility in ensuring each dollar is used
to further Godâ€™s kingdom.

Because VBVMI is largely an online ministry, our overhead expenses are very low.
We only employ one part-time staff member in addition to contract workers to
operate and maintain our online services.
